### üê∂ My Pet:
On the pet navigation page, you can see your pet's current statistics, including:

- **Mood**
- **Happiness level**
- **Energy level**
- **Cleanliness level**

These levels gradually drop as you study, and your pet's animation reflects the current stats.

To improve your pet‚Äôs mood and raise its stats, you can interact with it by either:

- Clicking on the virtual pet and selecting an interaction  
- Navigating to the pet page and choosing an interaction

You can **feed**, **play with**, or **groom** your pet, and the animation will reflect your chosen interaction.

Additionally, there is a **Productivity Actions** category to complete a timer, and a **Settings** category that allows auto-care for your pet while studying to minimize distractions.
