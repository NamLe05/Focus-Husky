## Pomodoro Technique
Our app builds on the Pomodoro Technique by adding playful pet animations to make focus sessions more engaging and fun. The Pomodoro Technique, developed in the late 1980s, is a time management method that breaks work into 25-minute intervals called “Pomodoros,” followed by short 5-minute breaks. After every four intervals, users take a longer break. This structured approach helps reduce mental fatigue, improve focus, and make tasks feel more manageable. By combining this method with cute virtual pet experiences, our app transforms productivity into a more rewarding and enjoyable experience for users.

## Features
Some of the features of our app include a pomodoro timer and a virtual pet which will both serve to help the user focus on completing tasks. The virtual pet and timer can be customized to the users’ satisfaction (pet type, color, accessories, pomodoro timer duration and breaks). Both features will be present on the screen as the user is working, and the virtual pet will be able to move across the screen and can also be clicked on for interaction purposes. The virtual pet will also ensure the user is focusing on tasks during work time and will send reminders if they get distracted. The application can connect with canvas and calendars to merge assignment schedules and also keep track of tasks. Once a task is completed or a study session is successful, the user will be rewarded with points that can be used towards purchasing accessories for their virtual pets. Also, you can add friends in the application and compete with your friends’ pets and share achievements. 


## Goals
Develop an app to help college students with focus and productivity when studying and completing assignments. Expand our understanding of desktop app development and gain valuable experience in developing a project from scratch within a team. Deepen our knowledge of frameworks and tools such as Electron, React, and Node.js. As well as strengthen our mastery in languages such as JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. Transform the isolating and tedious experience of academic work into one that is engaging and rewarding.


## Technology stack
 - Electron desktop app
 - AI for art generation
 - HTML, CSS, and JS/TS
